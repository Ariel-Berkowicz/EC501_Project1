Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is vitally important in today’s world because it protects people, companies and organizations from being vulnerable to data theft, manipulation, damage, and potential criminal acts. People throughout the world are interested in this topic because a data breach can affect their whole life. Cybercrime affects people on a personal level, as when their own personal identifiable information, health information, education, work, financial institutions and investments, social connections, and more are breached. It can also affect groups, institutions and businesses large and small with cybercriminals manipulating, hacking into, stealing information, and even halting work altogether.

Currently, the most commonly used smartphone platform in the world is Android. The open, programmable, and networked design of the Android makes these devices highly desirable, yet, as noted by Shabtai et.al., at the same time, highly “susceptible to various malware threats, such as viruses, Trojan horses, and worms (2010).”

From a security standpoint, it is very important to analyze an application in order to detect software bugs and flaws. Security analyses are generally run on two levels: static and dynamic. Static code analysis is performed prior to executing the running of code, and dynamic level analysis is conducted after the code is executed. This paper will focus on static code analysis, an analysis of the source code before the program is run. This type of analysis can reveal important information about the devices targeted, the software dependencies, vulnerabilities in source code, functional errors, and suspicious code. More and more software companies are requiring static code analysis as part of the build process in the initial phase to ensure high quality codes. This procedure helps software developers and companies financially over time and potentially saves the end user the grief and frustration suffered by having their personal information compromised and their funds possibly lost or stolen.

Static code analyses can be done manually, but developing an automatic classifier that distinguishes malicious from benign applications will benefit software developers and companies as it will save time, effort and money. Other advantages of automatic processing are: (1) It may detect potential bugs and errors which may be missed by manual code reviews; and (2) it would be done in a more rapid and efficient manner. With the automatic classifier tracing and scanning all files and codes, the highest possible quality of code can be achieved for the end-user.

When performing the literature review for this paper, I came across a number of papers and articles that highlighted current concerns of security breaches to Android apps, reviews of currently used detectors, and articles that compiled their own literature review. Here are my findings:

In the 2019 Forbes article called “Many Popular Android Apps Leak Sensitive Data, Leaving Millions of Consumers at Risk,” AJ. Dellinger, a freelance tech reporter and editor, writes about the research conducted by NowSecure, a mobile app security firm, on the data breaches that leaked sensitive personal data of millions of consumers. They found that phone apps of all categories were vulnerable, but that the apps of retail stores (both online and brick and mortar stores) were the most vulnerable. Travel category apps were also quite susceptible to hacking, accessing sensitive documents such as passport information and other forms of identification, as well as payment methods. NowSecure also found ongoing data leaks from financial and insurance apps (e.g., Berkshire Hathaway app), where they failed to encrypt potentially sensitive data, leaving usernames, phone numbers, email address, GPS location and device ID open for the taking. The security firm also found that nearly all the news apps it tested “leaked consumer data and 40 percent of them had serious security vulnerabilities that could result in sensitive information being stolen.” Of the 250 top smart phone apps tested, NowSecure found that 45 percent of them put the personal information of consumers at risk by using weak encryption or by leaving customer data in plaintext. Twenty apps could have their data intercepted with “further compromise through phishing attacks that can be used to infiltrate corporate systems and steal private data,” as they were susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks

Ruth C. is a Cybersecurity Researcher and Publisher at Atlas VPN, an internet security company. In her article, she reports findings based on a report by the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center (CyRC) on The State of Mobile Application Security: “63% of Android applications had known security vulnerabilities in Q1 2021, with an average of 39 vulnerabilities per app,” and that the most vulnerable categories were gaming and financial apps. Of the top free game apps and top grossing game apps, 96 and 94 percent contained vulnerable components, respectively. Of banking apps, 88 percent contained vulnerabilities, while 84 percent of budgeting apps and 80 percent of payment apps had vulnerable components. In addition, vulnerabilities were detected in about more than 50 percent of productivity apps, educational apps, tools for teachers, and entertainment apps. Of all the Android apps vulnerabilities, 44 percent were deemed as representing a tangible threat, of which 1 percent were Remote Code Execution, where a cybercriminal is able to gain system-level privileges and execute any code they want. Although, out of all the vulnerabilities, only about 6 percent do not have publicly documented fixes.

A prime example of the vulnerability of games is presented in the article entitled “Data Breach Warning for 200 MILLION Android and Ios Gamers.” Davey Winder reports on the 2019 data breach of one of the biggest social gaming developer companies, Zynga. The player databases of both Android and iOS platforms of social games such as Farmville, Mafia Wars, Zynga Poker, Draw Something, and Words with Friends were breached. The cybercriminal claiming responsibility called himself Gnosticplayers. Data that was potentially compromised were: names, email addresses, login IDs, hashed (SHA1 with salt) passwords, password reset tokens if one had ever been requested, phone numbers, Facebook IDs if connected to the social media platform, Zynga account IDs. For another 7 million players of Draw Something and OMGPOP, clear-text passwords were compromised as well.

In their ACM article entitled “The Evolution of Android Malware and Android Analysis Techniques,” Tam, et al. survey the effectiveness of leading Android malware detection analyses. They evaluate industry solutions, malware statistics, and techniques of malware evasion, such as encryption, native exploits, and virtual machine (VM)-awareness. This article examines how malware and analysis techniques influence each other.

Installed malware uses privilege escalation to attack Android OS or kernel vulnerabilities to gain root access of the phone to divulge data leaks of the device and/or owner. Additionally, remotely controlled spying malware (“bots”) can be used to deny service (“denial of service” attacks) by rerouting traffic to a different address or by denying “services of other apps (including anti-virus apps) by overusing resources (e.g., battery, bandwidth) and tampering with necessary files or processes.”

Tam, et al, found in their survey that “the Android permissions system continues to introduce dangerous permissions and fails to deter malware from exploiting vulnerabilities and performing escalation” because of poor documentation, poor developer habits, and malicious behaviors. Some noted the following effective static analysis techniques: Network traffic analysis seems to be effective in detecting bot behavior and leaked data. Studying library and system Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) can also detect malware. Dependency graphs can point out similarities such as plagiarism, while control flow graphs (CFG) detect information leaks based on sensitive data returned by APIs or content providers. Another approach is to have DroidSIFT create semantic signatures for classifying malware by creating contextual, API dependence graphs to construct feature sets. Analysis based on features from decompiled apps seek to enforce security policies by analyzing the actual feature and its frequency, but it cannot reveal when and how the permission was triggered (the context). Taint analysis is a method used to detect leaked data by tracking the flow of information in the system. It follows the taint labels created by tainted sources on data from the taint source to a destination (taint sink). Although implicit information flows (IIF) are more difficult to track than explicit, researchers were able to detect multiple leaks by tainting data as safe, tainted, or poly (safe or tainted depending on the context). In order to detect stealth behaviors, inter-process communication (IPC) analysis is used to track the movements of intents within IPC. Static analysis of the Android Manifest of an APK can detect issues in the hardware components.

Sydur Rahaman, et al. in their 2021 ACM article on “Algebraic-Datatype Taint Tracking, with Applications to Understanding ANDROID Identifier Leaks” address the shortcomings of current taint analyses with regards to Android operating systems and introduce a new, “algebraic-datatype taint analysis that generates rich yet concise taint signatures involving AND, XOR, hashing – akin to algebraic, product and sum, types.” The taint analyses currently used (FlowDroid, TaintDroid, and Amandroid) track whether data from privacy-sensitive sources flow to an insecure sink (a network leak), but this simplification is imprecise and ineffective in cases where taint sources are mutually exclusive, or where flows combine sources. It also does not capture source processing or the severity of the leak, nor does it identify “leak signature.”

The algebraic-datatype taint tracking approach that Rahaman et al. performed on 1000 top apps from Google Play and their embedded libraries addressed these inadequacies. They eliminated a source of imprecision in current analyses by discerning between “raw” and hashed flows. They identified apps and libraries that use hardware identifiers, which is against Google Play’s guidelines, and they found that the predominant source of leaks was third -party code, and not app code. They were able to discern which program leaked less than another program. They exposed potential de-anonymization practices, and they showed how apps have become more privacy-friendly since 2019.

In his 2020 web article on “Static Code Analysis in Android,” Kayvan Kaseb introduces some of the tools used in Android Static Code Analysis. He reviews the following open-source code analysis tools: Programming Mistake Detector (PMD), FindBugs, Checkstyle, and Lint. PMD finds common possible bugs, dead code, empty if and while statements, over-complicated expressions, sub-optimal code, classes with high cyclomatic complexity measurements, duplicate code, and copy-paste codes in a number of languages including Java. FindBugs analyzes Java byte-code to find bugs and problems as in class defines equals(), but not hashCode(), confusing method names, impossible downcast, repeated conditional tests, and useless objects. It also detects if empty finalizer should be deleted, if synchronize and null check are on the same field, if TestCase has no tests, and if field should be package protected. Checkstyle analyzes the source code used for design and method design problems and checks code layouts and formatting issues. Lint reviews the source files for flaws and recommends improvements in optimization “for correctness, security, performance, usability, accessibility, and internationalization.”

In their paper on “Automated Static Code Analysis for Classifying Android Applications Using Machine Learning.” Shabtai, Fledel and Elovici use Machine Learning classification algorithms to detect suspicious, malicious applications in games and tools. Using a test collection of 2,285 Android .apk files, they conclude that Machine Learning may assist in this detection.

In the article by Demissie and Ceccato on “security Testing of Second Order Permission Re-delegation Vulnerabilities in Android Apps,” they discuss an ongoing security breach issue. In the Android model, to ensure that apps can only access their own resources, each app runs in a sandbox. To further restrict the level of access, a permission-based system is in force. To access private data (e.g., photos, contacts) or to perform sensitive tasks, such as making phone calls or recording audio, the system requires apps to request the corresponding special permission and has the end-user confirm the request.

![](media/e0bd9773327383ac00605e77ab849df3.png) With the special open nature of the Android ecosystem, apps communicate with each other by exchanging special messages called Intents (Inter-component Communication (ICC). However, with the pressure of getting an app to market as fast as possible, apps are often released without proper testing and can potentially contain implementation defects that may compromise the security and privacy of the end-user’s data (“Permission Re-delegation vulnerability”). Furthermore, in the case of “Second Order Permission Re-delegation” “a malicious app may hijack a defective privileged app and exploit it as a proxy, to forward attacking Intents to system components.” To the right is the visual presentation of the difference between First Order (tope line) and Second Order Permission Re-delegation (lower line). In this case, the attacking app is allowed to initiate a phone call by using the communication app as a proxy to reach the system app.

Demissie and Ceccato conclude that current static analysis approaches are ineffective in detecting this type of vulnerability, because the vulnerability uses a commonly used inter-app Intent message which does not involve executions of permission-protected API methods. The system app is not able to block the attack, because the request is coming from a benign (although vulnerable) proxy app that is granted special permissions. Actually, they showed that the reason why the multi-app analysis techniques used today do not detect the permission re-delegation vulnerabilities due to programming mistakes is that they are focused on exposing privacy leaks, whereas the approach that Demissie and Ceccato used—automatically generating the execution test case scenarios--found 27 real vulnerabilities with fast analysis time. However, they noted the following limitations to their approach: Since it is a static analysis, it suffers from the inherent problems of static analysis techniques such as obfuscation and fuzzing (because not all the relevant attack scenarios might be generated). Another limitation was due to not having a documented list of Actions strings that require a special permission.

Another security issue that has exploded is addressed in the paper by Hu et al on “Security Threats from Bitcoin Wallet Smartphone Applications: Vulnerabilities, Attacks, and Countermeasures.” With the popularity of cryptocurrency, there are many apps that allow financial transactions using Bitcoin wallet (e.g., Coinbase, Luna, bitcoin Bitcoin Wallet). In this paper Hu et al. identify three current security vulnerabilities and what they developed to counter them. They found that the causes of the vulnerabilities were the improper implementation of Bitcoin wallet applications and the operational slips of wallet service providers. They three vulnerabilities are: Bitcoin deanonymization (of user’s real identities, Bitcoin addresses and transactions), reflection and amplification spamming (because there is no anti-spam defense of downloading Bitcoin transactions), and Bitcoin wallet fraud attacks (due it’s decentralized payment network). To counter these vulnerabilities, Hu et al. developed a phone-side Bitcoin Security Rectifier to help users secure their Bitcoin wallet smartphone applications from financial fraud attacks and private data leakage without any modifications to Bitcoin wallet applications.

In “A Survey of Android Malware Static Detection Technology Based on Machine Learning,” Qing Wu et al. wrote an extensive comparison of the latest research in Android malware static detection technology based on machine learning in his article on “A Survey of Android Malware Static Detection Technology Based on Machine Learning.” According to Wu, et al., detection methods based in machine-learning have the following advantages: efficiency, comprehensiveness of the detection, accuracy of the detection, and reduction of dependence on experts. Malicious activities can be detected by most machine learning methods as they conduct classifications of multiple families, and SVM, Naïve Bayes, Perceptron, and deep neural network algorithms keep improving the accuracy of identifying the malicious app, code location, and multiclassification.

Static code analysis advantages: It can cover all code and resource files. Since it does not need to run the application, it is more efficient, reliable and can check for malicious applications without the malicious application perceiving it was identified. Static code analysis makes it easier to generate fingerprint identification of large-scale malicious applications. It checks permission, component, intent, constant string, resource file, Opcode and API, native code frequency, and control flow graph and data flow graph features for malicious apps.

Static code analysis challenges: Code obfuscation and deterioration issues of machine learning models. There has been research in recent years to counter both issues. To counter the main code obfuscation methods of identifier renaming, string confusion, call indirection, junk code insertion, and dynamic code loading, in 2014-2020 researchers have come up with the following countermeasures: For identifier renaming, Ficco compared the API call sequence. For string confusion, Suarez-Tangil et al. boosted the way cryptographic system API calls were checked. For call indirection, “Garcia constructed a detection framework that used sensitive API usage, data flows between APIs, intent action, and package API usage features.” For junk code insertion, the source-sink data flow works “because the influence of the inserted junk instructions on the data flow is limited (Artzt et al.). For dynamic code loading, “Poeplau constructed the super control flow graph (sGCFG) to check sensitive function calls and parameter passing. To address the deterioration issues, in 2019 and 2020, researchers Fu, Cai, Jenkins, Zhang and Xu tried to achieve better performance from the malware classifier and to slow down model aging. Zhang built an API Graph based on API features and Xu expanded the API features base “to train a variety of online learning models in a model pool that can determine the drift samples and update the aging model in a weighted voting style.”

Machine learning algorithms can construct either fast running, simple classification models that are not too precise, or complex machine learning models which are inefficient but highly accurate. Many methods try to find the middle-ground between the two for efficiency and accuracy. Examples of simple (shallow) algorithm models are: logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, support Vector Machine, *k*-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Complex models are the following deep neural network models: Deep Belief Network, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Generative Adversarial Network, Multimodal Machine Learning, Multiple Kernel Learning, Graph embedding, and Representation learning. Currently, there is more research being done on the shallow models, especially SVM algorithm. Of the deep neural network models, CNN algorithm was studied most.

The limitations of the algorithms used in static machine learning-based detection methods are: Without a standard benchmark dataset, one cannot really determine which detection method is better or worse. Machine learning has good classification ability for known malicious applications, but it is poor in detecting new and unknown malicious applications. Some machine learning methods are not able to counter code obfuscation and therefore work poorly.

Based on the limitations of the current static machine learning-based detection methods, future research will include studies on enhancing deep learning methods to improve efficiency and speed while maintaining accuracy, enlarging the scalability to support large-scale detection, develop detection models that can identify 0-day attacks and new malware, and create defense mechanisms for machine learning algorithms to ward off attacks of poison, spoofing, impersonating, and inversion.

The topic of cybersecurity is extremely important in today’s society. There is a war out there and all smart phone users are on the front lines. With profit-driven incentives on the black market, more cybercrime is inevitable. Safeguarding each person’s individual personal identity, information and finances is vital to the individual and the companies and institutions with which they do business. It is vital to each nation’s security and well-being. Unfortunately, mobile phones have limited on-device analysis capabilities and are vulnerable through their various “connections” (e.g., Wi-Fi, SMS, Bluetooth, MMS, web browsing, etc.) and tech drivers (for the camera, compass, and accelerometers) (Tam, et al., 2017). There are also concerns of security breaches when end-users use apps that are developed by foreign entities which have direct support or supervision from the government. One real-life scenario recently was brought to light when Zhang Feng, an executive at China’s Shenzhen Tencent Computer System Co Ltd was detained by authorities, accused of leaking user data from the messaging app WeChat to Sun Lijun, the former vice public security minister. WeChat is the social communication services app of choice in China and Asia and it is growing in popularity here in the United States. As noted in the article in Asia Financial, “once a Chinese tech company grows beyond a certain size, government officials play a role in the firm, be it approving technology and sharing data.”

More and more people are using Family Locator (FL) apps for safety and convenience to keep tabs on their children, the elderly or people with mental or physical disabilities. Besides accessing the history of their whereabouts, some apps allow remote activation of the microphone and camera of another family member’s phone. Alkhattabi, et al. studied 41 FL apps from the Google Play Store. These apps are unique in that they not only monitor the individual, but they monitor the individual and their family members. If an individual’s data is breached, then the whole family’s data is breached. This can be a problem, when, for example, a whole family’s location notes that they are away, giving a green light for thieves to rob them.

To understand the types of sensitive information these apps would collect, Alkhattabi et al. reviewed the permissions requested by these apps, and followed up with an analysis of their network traffic and local storage. The researchers found that these apps collected sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) on the users, their locations and their contacts. The study revealed the presence of significant security and privacy vulnerabilities, with 80.4% of the FL apps having leaked sensitive information or join codes in plaintext (codes which would allow a cybercriminal access to join a family’s group and perform malicious behavior). In addition, they found that 15.1% of 33 apps leaked sensitive information through authentication and authorization vulnerabilities from back-end servers. They concluded that the problem lies with the fact the FL apps do not use encryption mechanisms. They suggest that users create a VPN channel in their phone to protect against network vulnerabilities as this will encrypt all in- and out-bound traffic regardless of the app, and they recommend that developers implement security mechanisms so that only secure channels, such as an SSL connection, is used to transmit user data. In addition, to prevent join code leakages, they recommend that the FL app set up a short lifetime for the join code and generate a new, randomly-selected join code for each new member that can be used only once.

Although Android applications continue to be vulnerable to attacks, the number of apps in Google Play is growing and as of June 2020 topped 2.99 million (Wu, 2021). and according to AV-TEST Institute, in January-June 2020, there were about 1.8 million new malicious apps (Wu, 2021). Google Play Store filters out as many malicious applications as it can, but many manage to get through. Other steps such as sandboxing at the system level and permission at the application level have been successful in classifying malicious applications, but there are many other vulnerabilities that cannot be readily detected by current anti-malware analyses, such as the colluding attack, where the malicious action is distributed across multiple applications. What is sad and concerning is that 73 percent of vulnerabilities first disclosed more than two years ago are still present in Android apps in the 2021 (Ruth C, 20 July 2021) even though 94% of the vulnerabilities have publicly documented fixes. Although since August 2015, the Android Open-Source Project (AOSP) disseminates monthly security patches to vendors, Farhang, et al., found that misinformation or delays in notifying the public of these security patches is a continuous problem, which leaves millions of smartphones vulnerable. Additionally, Jones, et al., studied the programs Google initiated to deliver security updates and OS upgrades in a timely manner, such as Android One, Project Treble and Project Mainline. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Android’s fragmented ecosystem, these have not been proven effective (Jones), with update delays averaging 19 – 26 days. With Android apps continuing to be built with open-source components, companies need to put in the time, effort and money to fix as many of the vulnerabilities as possible. One advance toward securing access to sensitive information came with the release of the Android 10 in 2019. Android version 10 and higher have the ability to set a directory on external storage and other apps cannot access this directory or its data. This is a good first step, but until everyone replaces their smartphones to the latest version, many people will still be susceptible to have their sensitive information compromised. Another way to secure one’s data is to encrypt the data using blockchain technology or by creating a SHA-256 encryption for the first layer while also ensuring that the data is stored in an encrypted multi-level tier system with firewalls and all. If I were to proceed in this topic, I can see myself working on doing research on putting CalyxOS to the test.
